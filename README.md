# motivate

⚡ **motivate** ⚡ - A simple script to print random motivational quotes.

## Why

This project was inspired by the Python version by Mubaris. I have been using the Python version for a while, but it was archived by the author. To continue the motivation and also as an opportunity to learn Rust, I decided to implement the project in Rust.

If you are looking for the Python version, you can find it [here](https://github.com/mubaris/motivate/tree/master).
