# motivate

⚡ **motivate** ⚡ - A simple script to print random motivational quotes.

## Why

This project was inspired by the Python version by Mubaris. I have been using the Python version for a while, but it was archived by the author. To continue the motivation and also as an opportunity to learn Rust, I decided to implement the project in Rust.

If you are looking for the Python version, you can find it [here](https://github.com/mubaris/motivate/tree/master).


## Requirements

```bash
git
rustc
```

## Installation

#### Linux/MacOs

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dxphilo/dotfiles.git
cd motivate
cargo build --release
sudo bash install.sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Windows

I haven't tested this project on a Windows system, but be sure to check for Windows configuration.

## Usage

If the installation is successful, you should be able to globally get random quotes in the terminal by running the command `motivate`. If the command name feels too long, you can set up aliases in your `.bashrc` file.

```bash
 motivate


"Don’t be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart."
